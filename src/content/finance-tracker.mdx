Finance Tracker is a portfolio-grade personal finance workspace that trades spreadsheets for a product-style experience. It focuses on clarity across transactions, accounts, budgets, and long-term insights.

The project is an end-to-end showcase: ingestion, categorization, reporting, and decision-ready insights wrapped in a UX-first interface with data-dense views and a clean service architecture.

## Why This Project

I wanted a personal finance workspace that felt like a modern product instead of a spreadsheet. The goal is clarity: see where money goes, how it compounds, and what to do next.

It is built as a portfolio-grade app, not a tutorial. Every screen is meant to be opinionated, fast, and practical for day-to-day tracking while still surfacing long-term trends.

## Highlights

- Data-rich reporting across yearly and total views, net worth trajectory, and category mix.
- Full CRUD flows across accounts, budgets, loans, investments, subscriptions, and taxes.
- Authenticated experience with AWS Amplify and Cognito-ready configuration.
- Async data orchestration via Redux Toolkit and redux-saga.
- Import pipelines powered by pandas and openpyxl for real-world bank data.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 19 + Vite 6 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI primitives, shadcn-style components, lucide icons.
- State and forms: Redux Toolkit + redux-saga, react-router, React Hook Form + Zod.
- Visualization: Recharts for analytics and Framer Motion for transitions.
- Backend: Python 3.13, SQLModel + SQLAlchemy, Pydantic schemas, Alembic migrations.
- Infrastructure: Serverless AWS Lambda handlers with Cognito via Amplify, provisioned by Terraform.

## Feature Deep Dive

- Transactions and imports: Multi-leg transfers, bulk ingest, preview mapping, and reconciliation with running balances.
- Categories and rules: Income vs expense types, icon and color metadata, merges, archival, and lifetime trend sparklines.
- Accounts and reconciliation: Balance tracking with debt metadata and explicit adjustment entries for audit-ready ledgers.

- Debt and loans: Principal, interest, minimum payment modeling, amortization schedules, and transaction-driven events.
- Investments: Holdings, cashflows, and performance metrics including realized and unrealized gains, TWR, and IRR.
- Goals: Target amounts and dates linked to accounts or categories with progress computed from live balances.
- Taxes: Payment and refund tracking with authority metadata plus monthly and yearly summaries.
- Reporting and analytics: Net worth trajectory, cash-flow volatility, and exports for projections and forecasts.
- Security and session handling: Amplify/Cognito-backed auth with session-aware loading and demo-safe flows.
