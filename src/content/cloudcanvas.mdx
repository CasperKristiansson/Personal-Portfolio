CloudCanvas is a product fork of Excalidraw focused on a cloud-first whiteboarding workflow. The goal is to keep the editor experience close to upstream Excalidraw while adding production-ready AWS infrastructure and hosted collaboration primitives.

## Highlights

- Google authentication with Cognito.
- Cloud API backed by API Gateway and Lambda.
- Drawing and asset persistence in S3 with metadata in DynamoDB.
- Workspace model with projects, folders, favorites, and recent files.
- Share links and share management with expiry and revoke controls.

## Engineering approach

CloudCanvas keeps editor internals near-upstream to make rebases practical, while CloudCanvas-specific product capabilities are layered in app and cloud modules. This structure reduces fork drift and keeps product iteration manageable.

## Tech stack

React, TypeScript, AWS Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Terraform.
