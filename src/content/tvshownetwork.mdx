TvShowNetwork is a unique website where users can sign up and share their insights on film and the TV industry. The platform was designed to help independent writers compete with larger blogs by joining forces, thereby improving their visibility on search engines and attracting a wider audience.

A standout feature of TvShowNetwork is its revenue-sharing model: authors earn a percentage of Google AdSense revenue based on the number of views their articles receive. In its first year, the site attracted around 80,000 visitors, underscoring its potential impact.

I developed the entire business model, website, and backend system. This included tracking visitor metrics per article and optimizing the site for SEO. Built on WordPress, the platform was enhanced with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a seamless user experience.
