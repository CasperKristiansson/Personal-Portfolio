This GitHub Action scans workflows, Dockerfiles, and runtime files to keep CPython patch versions current. It creates or updates a PR with minimal diff noise.

## Feature Overview

- Cross-file detection for Dockerfiles, workflows, runtime files, and tool configs.
- Resolves the latest stable patch with pre-release guards and python.org fallback.
- Predictable branch and PR automation with Octokit support.
- Dry-run previews, security keyword gates, and offline snapshots.
- Outputs change matrices for targeted CI fan-out.

## How It Works

- Scan the repo for pinned CPython patch versions.
- Resolve the latest patch for the configured track.
- Open or update a `chore/bump-python-<track>` pull request.
