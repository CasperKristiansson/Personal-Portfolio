A serverless, design-forward podcast hub that keeps every show you care about up to date. It syncs with the Spotify catalog, builds a living listening library, and surfaces the right episode at the right time. The goal is simple: remove the mental overhead of tracking dozens of podcasts and replace it with a clean, delightful command center.

## The wow moment

Podcast Tracker turns a messy, forgetful listening habit into a curated dashboard. New releases show up automatically, your progress is tracked show by show, and the interface feels like a premium listening OS rather than a generic list of episodes.

## Product highlights

- **Auto-synced show library:** Follow a show once and new releases stay current without manual refresh.
- **Deep show pages:** Episode lists, rich metadata, and progress state are merged into one view so you can decide what to play next.
- **Listening progress tracking:** Mark episodes complete, log the next episode in a series, or mark an entire backlog as done.
- **Profile intelligence:** A personal dashboard that surfaces completion stats and a spotlight list for what you should finish next.
- **Ratings and reviews:** Capture your thoughts with star ratings and optional notes.
- **Drop/return workflows:** Gracefully drop a show without losing its history.
- **Demo mode:** A full offline demo experience that mirrors real GraphQL behavior without requiring login.

## UX and visual direction

- A cinematic, dark UI with layered gradients, glows, and glassy panels that make content feel premium.
- Intentional motion and micro-interactions (hero blobs, starfields, hover reveals) to create depth and energy.
- A layout that keeps the search flow and library context always within reach.

## Architecture snapshot

- **Frontend:** Astro + React with Tailwind CSS for a fast, component-driven UI.
- **API:** AWS AppSync GraphQL with typed operations via GraphQL Code Generator.
- **Data:** DynamoDB single-table design with TTL and point-in-time recovery.
- **Compute:** Lambda functions for Spotify proxying, profile aggregation, progress mutations, and show detail composition.
- **Auth:** Cognito + Google OAuth, including a pre-token approval gate for access control.
- **Delivery:** S3 + CloudFront + Route 53, secured with strict response headers and HTTPS-only routing.
- **Infra:** Fully defined in AWS CDK with reproducible stacks.

## Data flow, end to end

- **Search:** AppSync -> Spotify proxy lambda -> Spotify API -> cache to DynamoDB -> typed results to the UI.
- **Show detail:** Spotify metadata + DynamoDB subscription and progress are merged in a single resolver for a unified view.
- **Progress updates:** Mutations write directly to DynamoDB through AppSync mapping templates for low latency.
- **Daily sync:** A scheduled lambda refreshes show metadata and episode counts to keep the library current.

## Technical highlights

- **Spotify proxy with caching and rate limiting:** Reduces API calls and keeps search fast.
- **Sanitized HTML content:** Spotify descriptions are cleaned and safe to render.
- **Typed GraphQL everywhere:** Schema-driven types shared across frontend and backend.
- **Hybrid resolver strategy:** VTL templates for direct writes, Lambda resolvers for aggregation and API fan-out.
- **Demo mode parity:** Demo GraphQL link mirrors real queries and mutations for a high-fidelity demo.

## Testing and quality

- **Vitest unit coverage** for lambdas, mapping templates, and data aggregation logic.
- **ESLint + Prettier** for consistent formatting and style.
- **TypeScript strictness** across the monorepo for confidence during refactors.

## Repository layout

- `apps/web`: Astro + React client app
- `apps/api`: GraphQL schema + AppSync VTL resolvers
- `packages/lambdas`: Serverless functions (Spotify proxy, profile, progress, show detail)
- `packages/shared`: Shared GraphQL operations and generated types
- `packages/ui`: Reusable UI components
- `infra`: AWS CDK infrastructure stacks

## Why this project stands out

Podcast Tracker is not just a UI. It is a full-stack product with real-world constraints: rate-limited third-party APIs, identity and access control, live data sync, and a performance-first static delivery stack. It blends a premium front-end experience with a production-grade serverless backend, showing end-to-end ownership from design to infra.
