EmberVault is a dark-mode, macOS-inspired notes app that runs in the browser while keeping everything on-device. It is built for speed, privacy, and a calm writing environment, with no accounts, no cloud sync, and no tracking.

## The Wow in One Paragraph

EmberVault blends a focused writing surface with a local-first storage model so your notes never leave your machine. It offers a block-based editor with Markdown-friendly blocks, fast navigation, and an information-dense right rail for outlines and metadata. The result is a lightweight product that feels native, stays offline-ready after the first load, and keeps your entire workspace private by default.

## Local-First Storage

- **Folder vault:** notes live inside a user-chosen folder on disk, leveraging the browser's folder permission model (best experience on Chrome and Edge).
- **Browser storage:** IndexedDB-backed storage for quick setup and broad browser compatibility.
- **Single workspace:** folders + tags organize everything in one consistent hierarchy.

## Writing Experience

The editor is block-based and Markdown-friendly, with rich blocks for code, tables, checklists, quotes, dividers, and LaTeX math. The interface stays deliberately calm: split panes, tabs, and a right panel keep context close without breaking writing flow.

## Search, Navigation, and Recovery

- **Full-text search** with filters and fuzzy matching to surface content quickly.
- **Tabs + split panes** for multitasking across notes.
- **Right panel** for outlines and metadata at a glance.
- **Favorites + Trash** with restore support so nothing is lost by accident.

## Offline + Privacy

EmberVault is offline-first after the initial load. There are no accounts, no tracking, and no background sync. Every note stays on-device, whether stored in a folder vault or the browser database.

## Tech Stack

SvelteKit, Svelte 5, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TipTap, IndexedDB, and MiniSearch.

## What Makes It Stand Out

EmberVault turns local-first from a buzzword into a product experience. The storage model is explicit, the editor is powerful without being noisy, and the UI keeps attention where it belongs: on the writing itself.
