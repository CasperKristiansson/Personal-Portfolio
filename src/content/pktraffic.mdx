PKTraffic specializes in in-depth public record searches of traffic-related incidents, providing expert analysis for improved road safety. The platform utilizes an intelligent application to explore, evaluate, and visualize traffic event data efficiently.

As Co-owner and CTO, I led the development of both frontend and backend IT solutions that drive the business. The frontend includes a data visualization tool for sorting and analyzing traffic incidents, along with the PKTraffic.com website. The backend involves managing a high-performance server that records and processes vast amounts of video data. My core responsibility is ensuring reliable IT infrastructure and secure data storage.

## Technologies Used

- React for website and admin panel, with Firebase authentication
- YouTube DL and FFmpeg for managing and downloading camera streams
- MySQL database for structured data management
- Lucidchart and Astha for system design
- Custom API for website-database communication
- PyQt and QT Designer for a desktop application to visualize and filter traffic footage
- Server management, task scheduling, and Git workflow
- Plex media server for data access
- Data collection via direct requests and Selenium automation

## Features

The core system continuously records and collects traffic data from thousands of highway cameras across Florida. Footage is processed to identify traffic incidents, which are then stored for long-term analysis. To improve system reliability, I developed an advanced logging mechanism to track various components, including the video recorder, addressing real-world challenges in debugging third-party software integrations.

Additional data sources include government traffic records and Waze reports, which are stored in a MySQL database hosted on Bluehost. The database was meticulously designed to handle complex relationships and ensure efficient data retrieval. Initial designs for the database and system architecture were created using Astha and Lucidchart to streamline development.

The PKTraffic website, built with React, serves as a user-friendly interface to showcase our work. To enhance user experience, I developed a searchable, paginated table that allows customers to filter traffic incidents captured by the system. This data is fetched from the database via a secure API, which follows best practices such as prepared statements to prevent security vulnerabilities.

The admin panel leverages Firebase authentication to grant controlled access. It provides a real-time system overview, displaying key metrics such as the number of detected crashes, total crashes in Florida, server storage utilization, and CPU performance. A detailed, paginated table further simplifies navigation through recorded footage and related data.

I also configured the backend server to handle essential system operations, including Git-based deployment workflows, task scheduling, and Plex media server setup for organized data management.
