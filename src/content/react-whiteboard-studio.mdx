React Whiteboard Studio blends high-touch canvas interactions with a thoughtful state architecture. It supports precise drawing, rapid navigation, and export-ready assets without breaking the flow.

## Highlights

- Fluid canvas UX with pan, zoom, snapping, and transforms.
- Rich shape toolkit with inline text editing and styling controls.
- Asset pipeline with IndexedDB persistence and exportable bundles.
- Project workspace with autosave, duplication, and lifecycle actions.
- Debug overlay and feature flags for safe experimentation.
