          <p className="mt-2">
            As the co-founder of two impactful companies, I am passionate about
            building scalable, innovative solutions. Klimra simplifies the
            process of claiming compensation for delayed train journeys in
            Sweden, while my U.S.-based traffic analytics firm focuses on
            advanced traffic data collection and analysis. Both ventures
            showcase my expertise in full-stack and cloud development, as well
            as my ability to lead projects from concept to execution.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            In addition to my entrepreneurial endeavors, Iâ€™ve worked extensively
            at Scatterin, where I developed a cloud-based platform for real-time
            data analysis of neutron and synchrotron experiments, handling
            large-scale datasets through AWS infrastructure.
