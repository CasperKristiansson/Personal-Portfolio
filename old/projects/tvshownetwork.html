          The goal of the application is to allow users to come together and write about the TV industry. Depending on how many
          views the article gets, the author receives a percentage of the revenue.

      <p>
        TvShowNetwork is a website where a user can sign up and write their reviews/articles on film and the TV industry.
        Starting a new blog can be hard, especially with competing against sites that post 5-10 articles a day. Climbing the
        Google search ladder is harder than ever. By writers joining together they can quickly beat the bigger article websites.
        The objective of the project is that the writers receive a share of what their article websites have received in google
        AdSense. During the first year of the website launching, it attracted approximately 80,000 visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have developed the business model, the website, and the backend of the site which includes keeping track of which and
        how many visitors each article author gets. The project also includes optimizing the website for SEO (search engine
        optimization). The website was designed using WordPress where I improved it by adding custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
