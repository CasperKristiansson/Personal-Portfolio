        <h1>MovieBoxDB</h1>
        <p>
          MovieBoxDB is a website that showcases movies. It is possible to search for a specific movie and observe information
          about that specific movie such as actors, release date, genre, score, etc.

        The goal of MovieBoxDB is to easily provide its users with a simple way to find and discover new movies. The site allows
        users to add shows to a watchlist and a favorites list where they can store their favorite movies. The site also has a
        score for each show, and it is possible to sort through all movies depending on multiple factors such as genre,
        language, release dates, region, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way that users can store their movies is by creating an account and logging in. This gives them access to edit
        various aspects of their profile such as bio, profile picture, and name. Creating an account also gives the user access
        to the MovieMatcher, which is a game inspired by the dating app "Tinder", where the user swipes in one of the four
        directions for movies depending on whether they want to skip, add to favorites, add to watchlist, or see more info about
        the movie.

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        One key goal that I had when creating the project was the design. I put a lot of time and effort into designing the
        website in Figma, to get a general sense of what the site should look like. The website has a few functionalities that
        are only visible on desktop and not mobile like the special view section for movies on the start page. The goal of the
        page that shows specific movie information is that it should give the users a “one-page design.” The page is not one
        page, but it gives the user a whole page with information like trailers, cast, storyline, score, and more. The project
        uses an MVC (model, view, controller) structure for all its pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        The discover page has one single purpose which is to give the user an option to sort through popular movies which can be
        sorted by different options, chosen for a specific year, or have a minimum rating. This allows the user to find for
        example what movies were most popular during the year 2008. The sorting option includes most and least popular, newest
        and oldest, top and worst rated and lastly, most and least revenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        When creating a profile on the page the user can add movies to the watchlist or favorites. This information is then
        stored in the Firebase Firestore database. The profile page provides a clean and easy overview of what movies are in the
        watchlist and favorites. When creating an account, the user is also able to use the functionality “MovieMatcher.”
        MovieMatcher is a tinder inspired game where the user is able to swipe right or left on different movies whenever they
        want to add it to the watchlist or skip it.
