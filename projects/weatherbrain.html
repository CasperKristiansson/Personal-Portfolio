        <h1>WeatherBrain</h1>
        <p>
          This application can through machine learning predict upcoming weather/weather phenomena. The application receives its
          data from an IoT-device that can measure certain weather parameters such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and
          humidity.

        The main goal of the project is to provide two main functionalities, one for providing real-time weather data from an
        IoT device and to provide accurate weather predictions. The website that is created will also provide statistics on
        future and past predictions against a bigger weather company like SMHI.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application will be able to give the stakeholders insight in upcoming weather using a prediction model. We believe
        that the prediction model that will be created will be able to predict the upcoming weather accurately. But as we know
        our product won’t be able to predict the weather better than other weather stations. Because of this, our goal is not to
        be better but rather to offer a solution. That solution is that most weather websites only offer weather reports for
        entire cities. Our product will be able to offer precise weather data at a specific position using the IoT device. This
        will give the user a chance to choose a location where to track and predict the upcoming weather.

      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

      <p>
        <p>
          The project was made nearly using only Microsoft Azure products. The following Azure technologies that were used were:
        </p>
        <ul>Virtual Machine (Ubuntu)</ul>
        <ul>SQL Database and Server</ul>
        <ul>App Service (website hosting)</ul>
        <ul>IoT Hub (an intermediate point between IoT device and database)</ul>
        <ul>Storage Account</ul>
        <p>
          Other technologies used in the project are:
        </p>
        <ul>Tensorflow for Machine Learning predictions</ul>
        <ul>Github workflow between the repository and app service</ul>
        <ul>Figma</ul>
        <ul>REST API</ul>
        <ul>IoT device (BME680 for weather data) and a raspberry pi</ul>
        <ul>Firebase hosting</ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        This project was part of the course Project and Project Methods (II1302). I as the project leader was responsible for
        the machine learning part of the project. This means that I was accountable for working with the previous years of data,
        building the prediction model, compiling the model, overseeing the data between the model and the Microsoft Azure
        database, and setting up the server. Below I will discuss more in detail what each task contains:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Previous years of data:</strong> This part of the project includes finding good weather data set. I was able to get this data
        from SMHI which had multiple weather stations all over the country. To find the best quality of data the project needed
        that the data should be logged every hour. The data sets also needed to fulfill the requirement of showing temperature,
        air pressure, and humidity. There were a lot of weather stations that had stopped tracking new weather data. To deal
        with this I combined multiple weather stations data.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Working with data:</strong> The next part was that I needed to make sure that the data had no anomalies which could end affect
        the prediction model. This means that I needed to make sure that the data didn’t contain any irregular data values. I
        did this by plotting graphs of the different values, heat maps, and normalizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Creating the model:</strong> The process I went through of creating the model includes testing over six different models to
        assess and understand which model from the Tensorflow library would fit best to predict weather (based on our data set).
        The type of prediction that we created is something called “time-series predictions.” During the creation of the model,
        I had to set up Tensorflow to use my GPU (this was a bit hard because I stubble upon problems with mix-matching versions
        of the program) to minimize the compile time (30 hours for CPU, 2 hours on GPU). During the creation of the model, I was
        also evaluating several types of inputs to the model to find the best parameters.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Managing new data:</strong> I was also responsible for overseeing the data between the model and the database. This includes
        updating the local data with the latest weather data from the IoT device. The prediction model uses the local data to
        create the latest predictions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Server:</strong> I was also accountable for setting up the server. The purpose of the server was to run the predictions daily
        and upload the result to the database. The server was also running the functions for the REST API.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Redesigning the webpage:</strong> When the course was finished, I took my time to redesign and add placeholder data because our
        Microsoft Azure student credits ran out. The website that is linked and displayed is my new design for the project.
