        <h1>Ecoloop Classification Tool</h1>
        <p>
          This project aims to create a website tool for detecting sulfide soil in Northern Sweden and Finland, which can cause environmental damage. Ecoloop, a small environmental engineering company, worked with the project team to improve the accessibility and usability of the tool.

        The project aims to address the issue of Sulfide soils that is mostly found in Northern Sweden and Finland around the gulf of Bothnia, by providing an easy-to-use tool that helps with the detection of such soils based on imputed soil data. The project was carried out in collaboration with Ecoloop, a small company based in Sweden and Norway, which primarily works within civil engineering and provides support to key actors to ensure that they work together around resource management in civil engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project was carried out in close collaboration with Ecoloop, who provided us with the necessary information and technical tools required to develop the sulfide soil detection website. We worked closely with the company to understand their requirements and ensure that the final product met their needs. Throughout the development process, we received feedback from Ecoloop and made adjustments to the design and functionality to achieve the best possible result. Our team was committed to using the latest technologies and design principles to create a user-friendly and effective tool for detecting sulfide soils.

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        The report highlighted the need to develop a smart, easy, and effective tool that is accessible to a wider range of users, which will save time and money for both the clients and Ecoloop workers. The project met two out of three technical requirements specified by the customer, and the implementation can be further refined by adding an option to upload documents with several inputs to be analyzed or adding a map functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The report also provided a background on the issue of sulfide soils and its harmful effects on the environment, as well as the background and mission of Ecoloop. The company's website, Optimass, was used as the platform where the application tool will later be accessible. The report emphasized that the tool is unique, as there is currently no similar website or tool about this subject since the problem of sulfide soil is not well known.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, the project aimed to create an easy-to-use tool that helps with the detection of sulfide soils, with the goal of increasing accessibility and usability of the tool, making it available to a wider range of users. The implementation technology used was not specified in the report. The project met two out of three technical requirements specified by the customer and can be further refined. The report also provided a background on the issue of sulfide soils and the mission of Ecoloop, which collaborated with the project to get the best result.
