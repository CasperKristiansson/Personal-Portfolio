        <h1>PKTraffic, LLC</h1>
        <p>
          A Project which focuses in collecting and analyzing traffic associated data in Florida, USA. The project includes
          recording and gathering video data from 1000â€™s of highways cameras to provide insight through post-processing to support
          safety and justice to traffic accident victims.

        PKTraffic specializes in deep public record search of traffic related data and events to provide expert analysis and
        support. Traffic related incidents is analyzed through an intelligent application which makes it easy to explore,
        evaluate and visualize data.

        I am one of the owners and CTO (chief technology officer) of the company. I developed the front- and backend parts of
        the IT Solutions enabling the business model. The frontend part includes a program which can visualize data and sort
        through traffic crashes and the website pktraffic.com. The backend of the project includes managing a server which
        records and processes a large amount of data and camera footage. My main responsibility is to assure well working IT
        solutions and that the data is securely stored.

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        The main part of the project is the process of recording and collecting traffic related data. Currently the server is
        gathering data from thousands of cameras in Florida every hour. The footage is than analyzed for traffic incident cases
        which than is stored for long term usage. I also built a more advanced logger for different parts of the system such as
        the recorder. Because the system has a lot of real life variables (recording of 3rd party software) it can be hard to
        debug incase if something goes wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other parts of the main unit include collecting traffic associated data from government sites and Waze. This information
        is than stored in a MySql database which is stored in Bluehost. The database has a well thought out design to manage all
        the different relations and tables. Different aspects of the system like the database were initially designed in either
        Astha or Lucid chart to provide a better overview when building them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The website was designed using react. The main purpose of the site is to provide our customers an unclouded vision of
        what we do. To provide a better experience I have also developed a pagination table for the customer to search for
        specific crashes that our system has captured. The table fetches the database through an API. The API is
        responsible for several parts of the project and therefore, it is required that the process for the API is securely
        built, for example by using prepare statements when making database calls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The admin panel uses Firebase authentication to securely give access to specific users. The primary purpose of the admin
        panel is to quickly give us an overview of the system. Using different intervals, the system shows the user how many
        crashes have been captured, how many crashes has happened in Florida, system hard drive usage, CPU usage and much more.
        The admin panel also has a more detailed pagination table to more easily navigate through all the footage and data that
        has been collected.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also have setup the server to run most of the backend functionalities of the system. This includes tasks such as
        setting up a git workflow between the repository and server, scheduling tasks, setting up Plex media server and much more.
