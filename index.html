        <h1>
          Hey there, I'm Casper
        </h1>
        <p>
          I am currently studying to become a University Engineer in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology in
          Stockholm, Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          My great interest in computer technology has already been rewarded through a large number of computer science projects.
          I have recently started two companies: one in the USA for traffic analytics together with my sister and her professor
          from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University and one company here in Sweden for my IT consulting services. In my spare time,
          I enjoy skiing, mountain biking, hiking, and I spend a lot of time in my great interest in stock investing.

          it is possible to sort through all movies depending on multiple factors such as genre, language, release dates, region

          access to edit different aspects of their profile such as bio, profile picture and name. Creating an account also gives
          the user access to the MovieMatcher, which is a game inspired by the dating app "Tinder", where the user swipes in one
          of the four directions for movies depending on whether or not they want to skip, add to favourites, add to watchlist or

          We are following the React structure for files, which means that we utilize a public folder where we store all our imgs
          and our index files. Then we have a source file where our main files are, such as index.js which is our rendering module
          where we use ReactDOM to render. In app we render each presenter, where we use react component router.
          Our project follows the MVP-structure: In our source folder we have the folders css, which contains all the css files
          for all styles for all pages as well as the earlier mentioned index.js. and App.js files. The source folder also
          contains a js folder that houses all our presenters, the views folder that holds all the views for all pages. Lastly the
          js folder also contains general files like apiFetch, model and firebaseConfig etc.

          The weather prediction application will be used by researchers and regular people. The application will be able to give
          the stakeholders insight in upcoming weather using a prediction model. We believe that the prediction model that will be
          created will be able to predict the upcoming weather accurately. But as we know our product won’t be able to predict the
          weather better than other weather stations. Because of this our goal is not to be better but rather offer a solution.
          That solution is that most weather websites only offer weather reports for entire cities. Our product will be able to
          offer precise weather data at a specific position using the IoT device. This will give the user a chance to choose a
          location where to track and predict the upcoming weather.

        <h5>Casper's Company</h5>
        <p class="p-medium">
          In the beginning of 2021, I founded my first own company. The business idea is to support companies with IT services
          such as developing frontend and backend programs and to provide IT support.
          
          During 2021 I developed a mass image editing program and a User-Friendly program for sending out one hundred or more
          ticket codes. The solution was developed for the Personnel Foundation for the Swedish postal service (postnordplus.com).

          I worked as an administrative assistant where I performed tasks like handling emails lists, labeling packages and
          working on events organized by the Personnel foundation PostNord Plus. My work during these years gave me the
          opportunity to develop two (2) IT-programs for the personnel foundation.
